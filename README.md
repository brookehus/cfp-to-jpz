# cfp-to-jpz
#### With rebus support ðŸ˜Ž

Haven't you always wanted to... you know... jpz your cfps? (Especially ones with rebuses?)

I put this together so I could fix a messed-up .jpz file for a rebus puzzle and I absolutely cannot promise it works in general.

Usage
-----
In a suitable directory, from the terminal, clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:brookehus/cfp-to-jpz.git
```

Install numpy if you need to, and then run:
```
cd cfp-to-jpz
python cfp-to-jpz [name of your cfp file]
```
